# Global Vision Case Analysis Project

## Overview
The Global Vision Case Analysis Project leverages data analytics and visualization to provide actionable insights for improving customer support processes and operational efficiency. By analyzing trends, resolving bottlenecks, and identifying key areas of improvement, this project enables Global Vision to better serve its clients and enhance its business operations.

## Objectives
- Analyze case trends across industries and regions.
- Identify challenges in case resolution time and propose optimization strategies.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights to improve efficiency and client satisfaction.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: In-depth exploration of case volume, resolution time, and severity-priority correlations.
- **Visual Insights**: Clear and interactive visualizations to identify patterns and highlight critical areas for action.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Tailored strategies to optimize resources and improve performance across industries and regions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dash

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/global-vision-case-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd global-vision-case-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset files (`accounts_anonymized.json`, `support_cases_anonymized.json`) are placed in the `data` directory.
2. Execute the following scripts in order:
   - **Data Processing**:
     ```bash
     python src/data_processing.py
     ```
     This step generates the `aggregated_results.csv` file required for subsequent scripts.
   - **Data Visualization**:
     ```bash
     python src/data_visualization.py
     ```
     This script uses the processed data to generate visualizations.
   - **Dashboard Visualization**:
     ```bash
     python src/dashboard_visualization.py
     ```
     This script generates an dashboard using the processed data.
3. Review the output data and visualizations in the respective directories.
